# Phishing URL Detector Chrome Extension

## Overview

This Chrome extension helps detect potential phishing websites by analyzing the current page URL. It uses a two-step detection process:

1. **Visual Mimic Detection:**The extension first checks if the domain visually mimics any well-known legitimate domains (e.g., `g00gle.com` mimicking `google.com`). It normalizes the domain to catch common character substitutions (like `0` for `o`, `1` for `l`, etc.) and calculates similarity scores against a whitelist of trusted domains. If a suspicious mimicry is detected, the extension immediately flags the site as **PHISHING** without running further analysis.
2. **Machine Learning Model Prediction:**
   If no visual mimicry is found, the extension extracts various URL features (lengths, special characters, presence of suspicious keywords, etc.) and feeds them into a TensorFlow.js model. This model predicts the likelihood that the site is phishing based on trained patterns. The extension then displays a verdict: **SAFE** or **PHISHING** with a confidence percentage.

## How it works

- On page load, the content script:
  - Extracts and normalizes the current URL's domain.
  - Compares the domain to a list of known legitimate domains for visual similarity using a custom normalization and Levenshtein distance calculation.
  - If similarity exceeds a threshold, it immediately flags the site as phishing.
  - Otherwise, it loads a TensorFlow.js model and a scaler to process URL features and predict phishing probability.
  - Shows a fixed notification box on the page indicating the verdict.

## Features

- **Fast Visual Mimic Check:** Detects common phishing tactics that use lookalike domains with subtle character substitutions.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Uses a pre-trained neural network to analyze URL characteristics beyond simple matching.
- **User-friendly Alerts:** Displays clear warnings or safe indicators directly on the page.

## Known Legitimate Domains (Whitelist)

The extension currently compares domains against these trusted sites:

- pepper.co.il
- paypal.com
- google.com
- apple.com
- microsoft.com
- amazon.com
- bankofamerica.com
- isracard.co.il
- ebay.com
- facebook.com
- btl.gov.il

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Load the extension into Chrome via `chrome://extensions` > "Load unpacked" and select the project folder.
